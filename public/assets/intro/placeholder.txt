HEMORA INTRO ANIMATION ASSETS
================================

Place your intro animation files here:

üìÅ PREFERRED: hemora_intro.glb
   - 3D animated droplet scene exported from Blender
   - Should contain droplet fall/splash animation
   - Optimized for web (< 5MB recommended)
   - See README.md for detailed export guidelines

üìÅ FALLBACK: hemora_intro.mp4  
   - High-quality video of droplet animation
   - 1080p, H.264, muted, 3-4 seconds
   - Auto-plays once then transitions to landing

üìÅ OPTIONAL: hemora_poster.jpg
   - Static poster image for reduced-motion users
   - High-resolution brand image or droplet still

USAGE:
------
1. Export your 3D droplet animation from Blender as hemora_intro.glb
2. Place the file in this directory (public/assets/intro/)
3. Navigate to /intro in your browser
4. The intro will auto-detect and play your animation
5. After completion, it smoothly transitions to the main landing page

The intro component will automatically:
- Try to load GLB first (with three.js)
- Fall back to MP4 if GLB not found
- Show static poster if neither exists
- Respect user's motion preferences
- Provide Skip button for immediate navigation

For development, you can test with placeholder content by visiting /intro
